[comment]: ## Project Description

Discovery is a fundamental building block in the scientific endeavor.
Discovery of new phenomena that are not explainable by current scientific theories stands often at the beginning of scientific revolutions.
The Automated Discovery project explores artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to aid the process of discovery in science and engineering.

The objective is to develop and evaluate methods that help scientists and engineers to explore the interesting and unknown behaviors of their systems of interest, be it in physics, chemistry, biology or computer science.

[comment]: ## Content

We present on this webpage our research and provide software for automated discovery.

#### Our Research:

[Automated Discovery of Patterns in Morphogenetic Systems]({% link index.md %})

We present a novel exploration algorithm that can autonomously discover morphogenetic patterns in high-dimensional complex systems.
We used Lenia, a continuous cellular automaton, as target system.


#### Software:

Coming Soon!
